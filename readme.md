# FAVORITE BOOK ASSIGNMENT!

Coding Dojo's Favorite Books Assignment. As well, my first attempt at using GITIGNORE and DOTENV to conceal my secret key!

Goals:

>> Create the User and Book models with all appropriate relationships
>> Incorporate a validated login/registration page  
>> On the main page, allow the user to add a new book, with validations. Added books should automatically be favorited by the logged in user.  
>> Have a list of all the books on the main page displaying the title and the user who uploaded the book  
>> When the title is clicked, display a page with the book's information, including a list of all users who have favorited that book  
>> If the logged in user has favorited the book, they should be able to "un-favorite" the book  
>> If the logged in user has not yet favorited the book, there should be a link to add this book to their favorites  
>> If the logged in user is the uploader of the book, allow them to edit (same validations apply) or delete the book
